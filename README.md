Welcome to Three Card Poker
This was a project we worked on last semester, using Java and HTML to create a server-client game, with a server that can handle 
up to 8 clients all with individual games.
The game has a game log that keeps track of all games

To play:
1. First start the server by inputting the port number 8000 and clicking start server.
2. Then connect your client by inputting 127.0.0.1 as the IP address and 8000 as the port number.
3. From there you should have successfully connected! You can bet anything from $5-$25 for the Ante and Pair Plus bet, you need a minimum of $5 on the ante bet to deal
4. Once you click deal, your cards will be drawn. You can choose whether you want to play or fold. Fold will end the current game. Play will allow the dealer to draw cards
5. If the dealer does not have a queen or higher in their hand, then they do not qualify and the game will reset but push the Ante bet
6. If the dealer does have a queen or higher, the game will calculate the game results and take you to a results screen with total earnings/losses
7. From there you can choose to play again or exit the game.
8. You can also choose to start the game fresh from the menu bar in the top left
9. The menu bar also has a "New Look" button which has different themes for the Interface to cycle through
10. To end the game, first exit the client, and then end the server.
11. You will also note that the server keeps track of all client activity, as well as how many clients are connected.

Happy playing!
